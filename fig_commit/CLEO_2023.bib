          , 
            Mid-infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging using inherent vibrational contrast has been broadly used as a powerful analytical tool for sample identification and characterization. However, the low spatial resolution and large water absorption associated with the long IR wavelengths hinder its applications to study subcellular features in living systems. Recently developed mid-infrared photothermal (MIP) microscopy overcomes these limitations by probing the IR absorption–induced photothermal effect using a visible light. MIP microscopy yields submicrometer spatial resolution with high spectral fidelity and reduced water background. In this review, we categorize different photothermal contrast mechanisms and discuss instrumentations for scanning and widefield MIP microscope configurations. We highlight a broad range of applications from life science to materials. We further provide future perspective and potential venues in MIP microscopy field.},

              Nondestructive chemical and mechanical measurements of materials with {\textasciitilde}10-nm spatial resolution together with topography provide rich information on the compositions and organizations of heterogeneous materials and nanoscale objects. However, multimodal nanoscale correlations are difficult to achieve because of the limitation on spatial resolution of optical microscopy and constraints from instrumental complexities. We report a novel noninvasive spectroscopic scanning probe microscopy method—peak force infrared (PFIR) microscopy—that allows chemical imaging, collection of broadband infrared spectra, and mechanical mapping at a spatial resolution of 10 nm. In our technique, chemical absorption information is directly encoded in the withdraw curve of the peak force tapping cycle after illumination with synchronized infrared laser pulses in a simple apparatus.

            This perspective highlights recent advances in super-resolution, mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy. It provides an overview of the different near field microscopy techniques developed to address the problem of chemically imaging specimens in the mid-infrared “fingerprint” region of the spectrum with high spatial resolution. We focus on a recently developed far-field optical technique, called infrared photothermal heterodyne imaging (IR-PHI), and discusses the technique in detail. Its practical implementation in terms of equipment used, optical geometries employed, and underlying contrast mechanism are described. Milestones where IR-PHI has led to notable advances in bioscience and materials science are summarized. The perspective concludes with a future outlook for robust and readily accessible high spatial resolution, mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy techniques.},

            Chemical imaging based on mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopic contrast is an important technique with a myriad of applications, including biomedical imaging and environmental monitoring. Current MIR cameras, however, lack performance and are much less affordable than mature Si-based devices, which operate in the visible and near-infrared regions. Here, we demonstrate fast MIR chemical imaging through non-degenerate two-photon absorption (NTA) in a standard Si-based charge-coupled device (CCD). We show that wide-field MIR images can be obtained at 100 ms exposure times using picosecond pulse energies of only a few femtojoules per pixel through NTA directly on the CCD chip. Because this on-chip approach does not rely on phase matching, it is alignment-free and does not necessitate complex postprocessing of the images. We emphasize the utility of this technique through chemically selective MIR imaging of polymers and biological samples, including MIR videos of moving targets, physical processes and live nematodes.},

Among the available spectroscopic approaches, GHz MIR dual-comb absorption spectrometers have the potential to simultaneously combine the high-speed, high spectral resolution, and broad optical bandwidth needed to accurately study complex, transient events in chemistry, combustion, and microscopy. However, such a spectrometer has not yet been demonstrated due to the lack of GHz MIR frequency combs with broad and full spectral coverage. Here, we introduce the ﬁrst broadband MIR frequency comb laser platform at 1 GHz repetition rate that achieves spectral coverage from 3 to 13 µm. This frequency comb is based on a commercially available 1.56 µm mode-locked laser, robust all-ﬁber Er ampliﬁers and intra-pulse difference frequency generation (IP-DFG) of few-cycle pulses in χ(2) nonlinear crystals. When used in a dual comb spectroscopy (DCS) conﬁguration, this source will simultaneously enable measurements with μs time resolution, 1 GHz (0.03 cm−1) spectral point spacing and a full bandwidth of {\textgreater}5 THz ({\textgreater}166 cm−1) anywhere within the MIR atmospheric windows. This represents a unique spectroscopic resource for characterizing fast and non-repetitive events that are currently inaccessible with other sources.},

Discrete frequency infrared (DF-IR) methods are now emerging in which a small number of measurements may provide all the analytical information needed. The DF-IR approach is enabled by the development of new sources integrating frequency selection, in particular of tunable, narrow-bandwidth sources with enough power at each wavelength to successfully make absorption measurements. Here, we describe a DF-IR imaging microscope that uses an external cavity quantum cascade laser (QCL) as a source. We present two conﬁgurations, one with an uncooled bolometer as a detector and another with a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector and compare their performance to a commercial FT-IR imaging instrument. We examine the consequences of the coherent properties of the beam with respect to imaging and compare these observations to simulations. Additionally, we demonstrate that the use of a tunable laser source represents a distinct advantage over broadband sources when using a small aperture (narrower than the wavelength of light) to perform high-quality point mapping. The two advances highlight the potential application areas for these emerging sources in IR microscopy and imaging.},
